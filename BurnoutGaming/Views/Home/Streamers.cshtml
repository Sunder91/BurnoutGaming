      Hey Guys, it's your favorite non-professional gamer and creator of Burnout Gaming and this is a sample page of what a partner page might
      look like.  If you are a streamer with the Burnout crew, you will be able to login and share some info that will show up on this page about yourself.
      I want my streamers to be able to go in and let people know they are going live, share any information about themselves, give advice to gamers or
      streamers and also gain access to some of our logos, overlays, etc that they can use for thier stream. My goal is to gain some team partnerships and
      affiliations so any other approved streamers can easily start finding ways to make a little extra cash without any hassle.  This bio page will also
      allow other streamers to show off any partnerships they have just by simply submitting them.  Down the line I would like to also add some cookies to
      the page so that people searching for streamers or thier affiliate partners can use thier reference links as landing pages.  This not only helps you
      promote your product but also maybe bring a few extra followers.  This will take some time to do so bear with me as we get up and running.
